//Q16:More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests
// to invite to dinner.
//â€¢ Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people 
//that you found a bigger dinner table.
//â€¢ Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
//â€¢ Add one new guest to the middle of your array. â€¢ Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. 
//â€¢ Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
               
let guest_List: string[] = ["Nimra", "Ahsan", "Kainat"];
guest_List.forEach(guest_List => {
console.log(`Dear ${guest_List}, would you like to join me for dinner?`)
})
//a guest who can't make it
let guest11: string= guest_List[1];
console.log(`\nUnfortunately, ${guest11} can't make it to the dinner.\n`);
//Replace the guest who can't make it with a new guest
let newGuest: string = "Ayesha";
guest_List[1] = newGuest;
console.log(guest_List);
// Print second set of dinner invitations
for (let guest of  guest_List) {
console.log(`Dear ${guest}, \n\twould you like to join me for dinner?\n\t`);}
let newGuest1: string = "Mohsin";
guest_List.unshift(newGuest1);
let newGuest2: string ="Ayan";
guest_List.splice(Math.floor(guest_List.length / 2), 0, newGuest2);
let newGuest3: string = "Neha";
guest_List.push(newGuest3);
for (let guest of  guest_List) {
console.log(`Dear ${guest},\n\twould you like to join me for dinner?\n\t`);}

//Q17:Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table wonâ€™t arrive in time for the dinner,
//and you have space for only two guests.
//â€¢ Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite 
//only two people for dinner.
//â€¢ Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name 
//from your list, print a message to that person letting them know youâ€™re sorry you canâ€™t invite them to dinner.
//â€¢ Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know theyâ€™re still invited.
//â€¢ Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually 
//have an empty list at the end of your program

let guestlist: string[] = ["Arohi", "Kanwal", "Nimra","Ahsan","Hassan"];
guestlist.forEach(guestlist => {
    console.log(`Dear ${guestlist}, would you like to join me for dinner?`)})
    console.log(" \nSorry, the dinner table can only accommodate two guests.")
//Removing guest
while (guestlist.length > 2) {
    const removedGuest = guestlist.pop();
    if (removedGuest) {
      console.log(`Sorry, ${removedGuest}, you can't be invited to dinne`);
    }
}
//print a message to remain guest
guestlist.forEach((remainingGuest) => {
    console.log(`${remainingGuest}, you're still invited to dinner.`)
  });
guestlist.slice(0, 2);
console.log(guestlist);

//Q18: Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world youâ€™d like to visit.
// â€¢ Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in alphabetical order.
//â€¢ Print your array in its original order.
//â€¢ Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.
//â€¢ Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it.
//â€¢ Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.
//â€¢ Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it again.
//â€¢ Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed.
//â€¢ Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show itâ€™s back to its original order.
//â€¢ Sort your array so itâ€™s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.
//â€¢ Sort to change your array so itâ€™s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order 
//has changed.
